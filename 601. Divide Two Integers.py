        The main problem with this question is to keep negative number tracks 
        and then also the int range in python as it uses dynamic memory allocation
        Trying to do a clear implementation to  ake this easy 
        For example, we divide(5000, 14):

        After the first inner loop: the_sum = 3584 which is 14 multiplied 256 times.
        We can't multiply any more â€” because after 256 is coming 256 + 256 = 512 and 14 * 512 = 7168 which is larger than our dividend, so we exit the inner loop,
        Reducing dividend: dividend = 5000 - 3584 = 1416
        And moving to another cycle of outer loop
        After the second inner loop: the_sum = 896 which is 14 multiplied 64 times.
        Third: the_sum = 448 which is 14 multiplied 32 times.
        And so on
        Finally we have: quotient = 256 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 1 = 357

        negative = (dividend < 0) != (divisor < 0)  # perform XOR
