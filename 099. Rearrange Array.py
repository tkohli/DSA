# Rearrange Array
"""
Rearrange a given array so that Arr[i] becomes Arr[Arr[i]] with O(1) extra space.

Example:

Input : [1, 0]
Return : [0, 1]
Lets say N = size of the array. Then, following holds true :

All elements in the array are in the range [0, N-1]
N * N does not overflow for a signed integer
"""
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # Modify the array A which is passed by reference. 
    # You do not need to return anything in this case. 
    def arrange(self, A):
        B = [0]*len(A)
        for i in range(len(A)):
            B[i] = A[A[i]]
        for i in range(len(A)):
            A[i] = B[i]
